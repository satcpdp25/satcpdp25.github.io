            <h2>Call for Doctoral Program Submissions</h2>
            <p>The Joint CP/SAT Doctoral Programme (DP) is open to all research students, including past participants, who are conducting research related to constraint programming and satisfiability. The goal is to provide an informal environment for networking, presenting and discussing ongoing work, and receiving feedback from both fellow research students and experts in the field. Participation requires a paper submission to the DP, reviewing other submissions to the DP and attendance in person.</p>
            <p>The DP is a two-day event (10-11 August 2025). The exact schedule is yet to be confirmed, but the currently planned structure of its content is outlined as follows: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Presentations and Poster Session:</strong> Each student is expected to give a presentation of their work, followed by a short Q&A session. Students with an accepted paper at the CP or SAT conference will give a shorter lightning talk, designed to pique the interest of the audience for their full presentation. Additionally, all students are required to create an A0 poster to be presented during the programme. The primary goal of the poster session is to encourage research and to promote the students' work to potential future collaborators.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Training:</strong> As part of the Doctoral Program, each participant will be assigned to review a submitted paper. The aim is to improve their reviewing skills by analyzing the work of their peers and receiving feedback from experienced researchers. The ultimate goal is to promote a positive reviewing culture, which is often disregarded in the field of computer science.</li>
                <li><strong>Invited Talks:</strong> Two mid-career or senior researchers will give invited talks to the DP participants. One of the talks will help students plan their career paths, while the other will focus on specific technical skills that are important to acquire for scientific research in the area of CP and SAT.</li>
                <li><strong>Mentoring:</strong> We plan to pair each participant with a mentor from the community, who is either a professor or a post-doctoral researcher attending the main conferences. The mentor will discuss the student’s poster and provide constructive feedback. This is intended to promote networking opportunities for the Ph.D. students.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Dinner:</strong> If sufficient financial support is obtained, a free dinner will be organized for DP participants on one of the evenings of the doctoral program. The dinner will be open to all students, invited speakers and chairs of the doctoral program.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Important Dates</h2>
          <p>Submission Deadline: <s>June 8 2025</s> June 10 2025 (AoE)</p>
          <p>Deadline for financial support requests: June 15 2025</p>
          <p>Review Deadline: June 22 2025</p>

        <section id="registration">
          <h2>Submission</h2>
          <p>To participate, students must submit a short paper. Papers must be primarily the work of the student and can be work in progress, completed work or recently published work. Students whose work has been accepted at CP 2025 or SAT 2025 can submit a two-page extended abstract summarising the key findings. Otherwise, students must submit an original paper of up to 8 pages describing completed or ongoing research or a summary of their research/PhD topic. Submissions can include up to one additional page of references.</p>
            <p>The submission form must clearly specify the student as the first author and list all advisors and co-authors. Papers must follow the LIPIcs guidelines of the main conferences, be in PDF format and not include author information in the text or metadata. All papers will go through a <b>double-blind reviewing process</b>, meaning that authors and reviewers are mutually anonymous. For this reason, submitted papers should not contain author names, affiliations, or links to identifying websites. As the DP aims to develop academic maturity of young CP and SAT researchers, all reasonable submissions will be accepted.</p>
            <p>All abstracts and papers should be submitted online through EasyChair by selecting “New Submission” at <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=satcpdp25">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=satcpdp25</a>. (If you are submitting an abstract only, please still submit a PDF containing the title, authors and abstract.)</p>
            <p>Accepted papers will be made available online but not published in formal printed proceedings. This allows the submitted work to be reused and/or extended for submission to other conferences and journals.</p>
